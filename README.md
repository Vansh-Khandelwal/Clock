This clock is made using tkinter library and time library

Simple math (Trignometry) is used to set the hands of the clock by assuming the clock to be line whose one point is fixed at the center of the clock and the other point changes depending on the hour/minute/seconds

It also utilizes PIL(pillow) library to display the clock as an image 

In the backend the the image is getting update every time 1 sec elapses this changes the image displayed on the window and giving us a look that as if the clock is moving

Window is made using tkinter library
